# Datalog in minikanren

`datalog.rkt` is an implementation of Datalog (currently, without support for
negation) in minikanren. It has many comments and two examples (at the bottom of
the file).

`defunct-datalog.rkt` is an attempted implementation that didn't work out. Not
many comments, a few examples.

`datalog-interpreter.rkt` is a Datalog-without-negation interpreter in plain old
Racket, no minikanren. Not many comments, a few examples.
